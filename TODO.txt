Urgent (BUGS):


IMPORTANT (NECESSARY FEATURES):
 Figure out how to read terminal sizes and handle size changes in virtuals

 Turn keyboard echoing off 

 Read from keyboard
  
 Drawing speed is horribly slow, other programs manipulate ream terms faster
 this might because they draw lines instead of characters.

 Use a buffer system to ensure that the terminal only draws characters that
 need to he updated rather than drawing over the same character.
 

TRIVIAL (OPTIONAL BUT NICE TO SUPPORT):
 zdraw_line - draw a line to any two points with any character and optional '+' endpoints.

FEATURES FINISHED:

[DONE]zdraw_horizontal - draw a horizontal line with any character with 
  optional '+' endpoints.

 [DONE]	zdraw_vertical - draw a horizontal line with any character with 
  optional '+' endpoints.

 [DONE] zhide_cursor - hide the cursor

 [DONE] zshow_cursor - display the cursor
 
 [DONE] attribute modifying functions
